- [software engineer](https://github.com/DeMarko) who doesn't write code on the weekends.
- union steward (and other things!) for [my workplace's union](https://kickstarterunited.org/).
- union organizer and active member of [my local](https://www.opeiulocal153.org/)
- [a poster](https://bsky.app/profile/demarko.org), [a poster](https://xoxo.zone/@demarko), and a [retired poster](https://twitter.com/DeMarko)
